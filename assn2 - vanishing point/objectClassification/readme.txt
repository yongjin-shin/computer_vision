**
THIS CODE WILL TRAIN A MODEL WITH MULTI CLASSIFICATION THROUGH ONE VS REST TACTIC.
**

**FIRST OF ALL,
I EXTRACTED FEATURE MATRIX OF IMAGES BY HISTOGRAM OF ORIENTED GRADIENTS.
FOR HOG, I SET 5X5 CELL SIZE AND EACH BLOCK HAVE 2X2 CELLS. ALSO 9 BINS ARE USED.
L2 HYS NORMALIZATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. EXTRACTING HOG FEATURES ARE PRECEDED BY THE FUNCTION HOG_FEATURE_VECTOR.

**MULTI CLASSIFICATION
CAN BE ACHIEVED VIA LIBSVM LIBRARY(SVMTRAIN, SVMPREDICT)
AS I WANT TO HAVE A PREDICTION, FOR EACH FUNCTIONS, I USED -b 1 OPTIONS.
WITH FOR LOOP, I CLASSIFIED ONE LABEL AGAINST ALL OTHER LABELS

**DATASET
ARE FETCHED FROM 'dataset' FOLDER WIHTIN THE CURRENT FOLDER. FOLDER NAME SHOUD HAVE THEIR LABEL NAME.
FOR THE TRAINING SET, 60% OF IMAGES IN THE DATASET OF EACH LABELS WERE USED, AND 40% WERE USED FOR TEST.

**THE OUTPUT
WAS PROVIDED WITH CONFUSION TABLE AND ACCURACY.
